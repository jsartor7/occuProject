I mostly wrote and tested on a linux server. Installed Apache and PHP exactly as described here and it worked fine on Windows: https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-php-on-windows/

Also, in case you new to Apache (like me):

open cmd
navigate to C:\Apache24\bin
'httpd' (starts the apache server)

open browser
navigate to localhost/occuProject/home.html
